This life-giving substance  is not, however, distributed evenly with (a) depth in the  oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface  layer 10 - 20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere  can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of  floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis.  Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and  reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths  of around 200 -1,000 metres. This region is referred to as  the oxygen (b) minimum zone. This zone is created by the  low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of  the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of  oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the  surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone,  oxygen content (c) increases again with depth. The deep  oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not  generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of  oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of  deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold,  oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That  seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby (d) exhausting its  oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface  waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively  scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms  therefore consume (e) little of the available oxygen. * dissolve: 용해시키다 ** diffuse: 퍼지다   \n",

Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans ① their first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, ② is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon ③ where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have ④ been used to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and ⑤ discovers deeper meanings in events. * monument: 기념비  ** eclipse: (해･달의) 식(蝕) *** testimony: 증언   \n",

              "      <td>Life in the earth’s oceans simply would not exist without  the presence of dissolved oxygen. This life-giving substance  is not, however, distributed evenly with (a) depth in the  oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface  layer 10 - 20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere  can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of  floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis.  Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and  reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths  of around 200 -1,000 metres. This region is referred to as  the oxygen (b) minimum zone. This zone is created by the  low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of  the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of  oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the  surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone,  oxygen content (c) increases again with depth. The deep  oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not  generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of  oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of  deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold,  oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That  seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby (d) exhausting its  oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface  waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively  scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms  therefore consume (e) little of the available oxygen. * dissolve: 용해시키다 ** diffuse: 퍼지다</td>\n",

Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans ① their first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, ② is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon ③ where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have ④ been used to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and ⑤ discovers deeper meanings in events. * monument: 기념비  ** eclipse: (해･달의) 식(蝕) *** testimony: 증언</td>\n",

However, after a great deal of thought, I have decided not to accept the position. Your company has an excellent reputation as a research institution and has many aspects that are very attractive to me. Unfortunately, I cannot accept your offer because I have decided to pursue another opportunity. Once again, thank you for your consideration. Very truly yours, Christine Mahoe   \n",

Technically, if they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they get what they want. That, however, is not all they want. They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy and consideration; and they are in a position to get what they want. They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and fundamental basis of public relations. In order, therefore, for a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must have a philosophy and a method of doing business which will allow and insure that its people serve the public efficiently and in a pleasing manner.   \n",

Every performer experiences this feeling, even the greatest performers in the world. If you believe that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove yourself right even when you are wrong. Most seemingly impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities, focusing on what is within your control, taking the first step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step after that. If your commitment becomes weak, remember your dream and why it is important to you, find simple joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing learning. With a positive perspective and persistence, you will get through and find a way through all obstacles.   \n",

Some forms of new media, however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate reality by stimulating our senses.   \n",

According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.   \n",

This life-giving substance  is not, however, distributed evenly with (a) depth in the  oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface  layer 10 - 20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere  can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of  floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis.  Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and  reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths  of around 200 -1,000 metres. This region is referred to as  the oxygen (b) minimum zone. This zone is created by the  low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of  the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of  oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the  surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone,  oxygen content (c) increases again with depth. The deep  oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not  generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of  oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of  deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold,  oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That  seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby (d) exhausting its  oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface  waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively  scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms  therefore consume (e) little of the available oxygen. * dissolve: 용해시키다 ** diffuse: 퍼지다   \n",
              "2786  (A)  Every May was the entrance examination period for a  famous art school. On the first day’s sketch test, Professor  Wells noticed great potential in a boy named Jack. During the  second day’s color test, when (a) he walked past the boy,  something special caught his attention. Every paint was  labeled, and there was a small piece of paper written in the  boy’s half-hidden paint box: apples are red, pears are bright  yellow. This talented student must be color blind! (B) The room was full of paintings and sculptures. Professor  Wells said, “Once, my dream was to be a basketball player.’  Jack was puzzled. “Why did you stop playing basketball?\"  Wells gently rolled up his left trouser leg - (b) his left leg  was an artificial limb. “Even if we cannot realize our original  dream, we will eventually open another door to our dreams.\"  Wells told Jack to close his eyes and touch a sculpture, and  Jack did so. “An artist’s hands are a second pair of eyes. Try  to see with them as well.\" (C) After that day, Professor Wells never saw Jack again. It  was not until six years later that he saw a report in the  newspaper about a recent exhibition of modern art. The  article said “This young sculptor was unable to attend art  school due to his color blindness.

Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans ① their first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, ② is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon ③ where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have ④ been used to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and ⑤ discovers deeper meanings in events. * monument: 기념비  ** eclipse: (해･달의) 식(蝕) *** testimony: 증언   \n",

Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside.

              "      <td>Recently, researchers have suggested that the purpose of laughter is not just to communicate that one is in a playful state, but to actually induce this state in others as well. According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Life in the earth’s oceans simply would not exist without  the presence of dissolved oxygen. This life-giving substance  is not, however, distributed evenly with (a) depth in the  oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface  layer 10 - 20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere  can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of  floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis.  Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and  reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths  of around 200 -1,000 metres. This region is referred to as  the oxygen (b) minimum zone. This zone is created by the  low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of  the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of  oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the  surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone,  oxygen content (c) increases again with depth. The deep  oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not  generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of  oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of  deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold,  oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That  seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby (d) exhausting its  oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface  waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively  scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms  therefore consume (e) little of the available oxygen. * dissolve: 용해시키다 ** diffuse: 퍼지다</td>\n",

However, after a great deal of thought, I have decided not to accept the position. Your company has an excellent reputation as a research institution and has many aspects that are very attractive to me. Unfortunately, I cannot accept your offer because I have decided to pursue another opportunity. Once again, thank you for your consideration. Very truly yours, Christine Mahoe   \n",

Technically, if they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they get what they want. That, however, is not all they want. They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy and consideration; and they are in a position to get what they want. They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and fundamental basis of public relations. In order, therefore, for a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must have a philosophy and a method of doing business which will allow and insure that its people serve the public efficiently and in a pleasing manner.   \n",

Every performer experiences this feeling, even the greatest performers in the world. If you believe that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove yourself right even when you are wrong. Most seemingly impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities, focusing on what is within your control, taking the first step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step after that. If your commitment becomes weak, remember your dream and why it is important to you, find simple joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing learning. With a positive perspective and persistence, you will get through and find a way through all obstacles.   \n",

Some forms of new media, however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate reality by stimulating our senses.   \n",

According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.   \n",

This life-giving substance  is not, however, distributed evenly with (a) depth in the  oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface  layer 10 - 20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere  can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of  floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis.  Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and  reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths  of around 200 -1,000 metres. This region is referred to as  the oxygen (b) minimum zone. This zone is created by the  low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of  the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of  oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the  surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone,  oxygen content (c) increases again with depth. The deep  oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not  generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of  oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of  deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold,  oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That  seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby (d) exhausting its  oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface  waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively  scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms  therefore consume (e) little of the available oxygen. * dissolve: 용해시키다 ** diffuse: 퍼지다   \n",

Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans ① their first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, ② is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon ③ where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have ④ been used to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and ⑤ discovers deeper meanings in events. * monument: 기념비  ** eclipse: (해･달의) 식(蝕) *** testimony: 증언   \n",

Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside.

According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.</td>\n",

This life-giving substance  is not, however, distributed evenly with (a) depth in the  oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface  layer 10 - 20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere  can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of  floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis.  Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and  reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths  of around 200 -1,000 metres. This region is referred to as  the oxygen (b) minimum zone. This zone is created by the  low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of  the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of  oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the  surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone,  oxygen content (c) increases again with depth. The deep  oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not  generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of  oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of  deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold,  oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That  seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby (d) exhausting its  oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface  waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively  scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms  therefore consume (e) little of the available oxygen. * dissolve: 용해시키다 ** diffuse: 퍼지다</td>\n",

During the  second day’s color test, when (a) he walked past the boy,  something special caught his attention. Every paint was  labeled, and there was a small piece of paper written in the  boy’s half-hidden paint box: apples are red, pears are bright  yellow. This talented student must be color blind! (B) The room was full of paintings and sculptures. Professor  Wells said, “Once, my dream was to be a basketball player.’  Jack was puzzled. “Why did you stop playing basketball?\"  Wells gently rolled up his left trouser leg - (b) his left leg  was an artificial limb. “Even if we cannot realize our original  dream, we will eventually open another door to our dreams.\"  Wells told Jack to close his eyes and touch a sculpture, and  Jack did so. “An artist’s hands are a second pair of eyes. Try  to see with them as well.\" (C) After that day, Professor Wells never saw Jack again. It  was not until six years later that he saw a report in the  newspaper about a recent exhibition of modern art. The  article said “This young sculptor was unable to attend art  school due to his color blindness. But with inspiration shared  by a mentor, (c) he replaced the eyes that could not  distinguish colors with his own hands and has become a star  in the field of sculpture.\" The sculptor was Jack. (D) After the art school announced the list of newly-admitted  students, Professor Wells found Jack looking longingly  through the school gate. It was the same boy who had  captured (d) his attention on the test. Wells greeted him.  “I’m Professor Wells, and I teach oil painting here.\" ‘My  name is Jack,\" replied the boy, “and I was rejected.\" Seeing  that the boy was heartbroken, (e) he invited him to a small  workshop of his own.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Most historians of science point to the need for a reliable calendar to regulate agricultural activity as the motivation for learning about what we now call astronomy, the study of stars and planets. Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans ① their first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, ② is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon ③ where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have ④ been used to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and ⑤ discovers deeper meanings in events. * monument: 기념비  ** eclipse: (해･달의) 식(蝕) *** testimony: 증언</td>\n",

However, after a great deal of thought, I have decided not to accept the position. Your company has an excellent reputation as a research institution and has many aspects that are very attractive to me. Unfortunately, I cannot accept your offer because I have decided to pursue another opportunity. Once again, thank you for your consideration. Very truly yours, Christine Mahoe   \n",

Technically, if they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they get what they want. That, however, is not all they want. They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy and consideration; and they are in a position to get what they want. They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and fundamental basis of public relations. In order, therefore, for a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must have a philosophy and a method of doing business which will allow and insure that its people serve the public efficiently and in a pleasing manner.   \n",

Every performer experiences this feeling, even the greatest performers in the world. If you believe that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove yourself right even when you are wrong. Most seemingly impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities, focusing on what is within your control, taking the first step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step after that. If your commitment becomes weak, remember your dream and why it is important to you, find simple joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing learning. With a positive perspective and persistence, you will get through and find a way through all obstacles.   \n",

Some forms of new media, however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate reality by stimulating our senses.   \n",

According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.   \n",

This life-giving substance  is not, however, distributed evenly with (a) depth in the  oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface  layer 10 - 20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere  can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of  floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis.  Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and  reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths  of around 200 -1,000 metres. This region is referred to as  the oxygen (b) minimum zone. This zone is created by the  low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of  the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of  oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the  surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone,  oxygen content (c) increases again with depth. The deep  oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not  generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of  oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of  deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold,  oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That  seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby (d) exhausting its  oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface  waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively  scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms  therefore consume (e) little of the available oxygen. * dissolve: 용해시키다 ** diffuse: 퍼지다   \n",

Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans ① their first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, ② is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon ③ where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have ④ been used to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and ⑤ discovers deeper meanings in events. * monument: 기념비  ** eclipse: (해･달의) 식(蝕) *** testimony: 증언   \n",

Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside.

According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.</td>\n",

This life-giving substance  is not, however, distributed evenly with (a) depth in the  oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface  layer 10 - 20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere  can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of  floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis.  Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and  reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths  of around 200 -1,000 metres. This region is referred to as  the oxygen (b) minimum zone. This zone is created by the  low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of  the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of  oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the  surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone,  oxygen content (c) increases again with depth. The deep  oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not  generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of  oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of  deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold,  oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That  seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby (d) exhausting its  oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface  waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively  scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms  therefore consume (e) little of the available oxygen. * dissolve: 용해시키다 ** diffuse: 퍼지다</td>\n",

During the  second day’s color test, when (a) he walked past the boy,  something special caught his attention. Every paint was  labeled, and there was a small piece of paper written in the  boy’s half-hidden paint box: apples are red, pears are bright  yellow. This talented student must be color blind! (B) The room was full of paintings and sculptures. Professor  Wells said, “Once, my dream was to be a basketball player.’  Jack was puzzled. “Why did you stop playing basketball?\"  Wells gently rolled up his left trouser leg - (b) his left leg  was an artificial limb. “Even if we cannot realize our original  dream, we will eventually open another door to our dreams.\"  Wells told Jack to close his eyes and touch a sculpture, and  Jack did so. “An artist’s hands are a second pair of eyes. Try  to see with them as well.\" (C) After that day, Professor Wells never saw Jack again. It  was not until six years later that he saw a report in the  newspaper about a recent exhibition of modern art. The  article said “This young sculptor was unable to attend art  school due to his color blindness.

Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans ① their first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, ② is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon ③ where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have ④ been used to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and ⑤ discovers deeper meanings in events. * monument: 기념비  ** eclipse: (해･달의) 식(蝕) *** testimony: 증언</td>\n",

However, after a great deal of thought, I have decided not to accept the position. Your company has an excellent reputation as a research institution and has many aspects that are very attractive to me. Unfortunately, I cannot accept your offer because I have decided to pursue another opportunity. Once again, thank you for your consideration. Very truly yours, Christine Mahoe   \n",

Technically, if they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they get what they want. That, however, is not all they want. They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy and consideration; and they are in a position to get what they want. They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and fundamental basis of public relations. In order, therefore, for a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must have a philosophy and a method of doing business which will allow and insure that its people serve the public efficiently and in a pleasing manner.   \n",

Every performer experiences this feeling, even the greatest performers in the world. If you believe that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove yourself right even when you are wrong. Most seemingly impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities, focusing on what is within your control, taking the first step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step after that. If your commitment becomes weak, remember your dream and why it is important to you, find simple joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing learning. With a positive perspective and persistence, you will get through and find a way through all obstacles.   \n",

Some forms of new media, however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate reality by stimulating our senses.   \n",

According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.   \n",

This life-giving substance  is not, however, distributed evenly with (a) depth in the  oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface  layer 10 - 20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere  can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of  floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis.  Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and  reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths  of around 200 -1,000 metres. This region is referred to as  the oxygen (b) minimum zone. This zone is created by the  low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of  the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of  oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the  surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone,  oxygen content (c) increases again with depth. The deep  oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not  generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of  oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of  deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold,  oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That  seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby (d) exhausting its  oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface  waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively  scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms  therefore consume (e) little of the available oxygen. * dissolve: 용해시키다 ** diffuse: 퍼지다   \n",

Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans ① their first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, ② is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon ③ where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have ④ been used to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and ⑤ discovers deeper meanings in events. * monument: 기념비  ** eclipse: (해･달의) 식(蝕) *** testimony: 증언   \n",

Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside.

According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.</td>\n",

This life-giving substance  is not, however, distributed evenly with (a) depth in the  oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface  layer 10 - 20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere  can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of  floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis.  Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and  reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths  of around 200 -1,000 metres. This region is referred to as  the oxygen (b) minimum zone. This zone is created by the  low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of  the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of  oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the  surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone,  oxygen content (c) increases again with depth. The deep  oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not  generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of  oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of  deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold,  oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That  seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby (d) exhausting its  oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface  waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively  scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms  therefore consume (e) little of the available oxygen. * dissolve: 용해시키다 ** diffuse: 퍼지다</td>\n",

              "      <td>(A)  Every May was the entrance examination period for a  famous art school. On the first day’s sketch test, Professor  Wells noticed great potential in a boy named Jack. During the  second day’s color test, when (a) he walked past the boy,  something special caught his attention. Every paint was  labeled, and there was a small piece of paper written in the  boy’s half-hidden paint box: apples are red, pears are bright  yellow. This talented student must be color blind! (B) The room was full of paintings and sculptures. Professor  Wells said, “Once, my dream was to be a basketball player.’  Jack was puzzled. “Why did you stop playing basketball?\"  Wells gently rolled up his left trouser leg - (b) his left leg  was an artificial limb. “Even if we cannot realize our original  dream, we will eventually open another door to our dreams.\"  Wells told Jack to close his eyes and touch a sculpture, and  Jack did so. “An artist’s hands are a second pair of eyes. Try  to see with them as well.\" (C) After that day, Professor Wells never saw Jack again. It  was not until six years later that he saw a report in the  newspaper about a recent exhibition of modern art. The  article said “This young sculptor was unable to attend art  school due to his color blindness. But with inspiration shared  by a mentor, (c) he replaced the eyes that could not  distinguish colors with his own hands and has become a star  in the field of sculpture.\" The sculptor was Jack. (D) After the art school announced the list of newly-admitted  students, Professor Wells found Jack looking longingly  through the school gate. It was the same boy who had  captured (d) his attention on the test. Wells greeted him.  “I’m Professor Wells, and I teach oil painting here.\" ‘My  name is Jack,\" replied the boy, “and I was rejected.\" Seeing  that the boy was heartbroken, (e) he invited him to a small  workshop of his own.</td>\n",

Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans ① their first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, ② is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon ③ where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have ④ been used to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and ⑤ discovers deeper meanings in events. * monument: 기념비  ** eclipse: (해･달의) 식(蝕) *** testimony: 증언</td>\n",

However, after a great deal of thought, I have decided not to accept the position. Your company has an excellent reputation as a research institution and has many aspects that are very attractive to me. Unfortunately, I cannot accept your offer because I have decided to pursue another opportunity. Once again, thank you for your consideration. Very truly yours, Christine Mahoe   \n",

Technically, if they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they get what they want. That, however, is not all they want. They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy and consideration; and they are in a position to get what they want. They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and fundamental basis of public relations. In order, therefore, for a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must have a philosophy and a method of doing business which will allow and insure that its people serve the public efficiently and in a pleasing manner.   \n",

Every performer experiences this feeling, even the greatest performers in the world. If you believe that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove yourself right even when you are wrong. Most seemingly impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities, focusing on what is within your control, taking the first step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step after that. If your commitment becomes weak, remember your dream and why it is important to you, find simple joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing learning. With a positive perspective and persistence, you will get through and find a way through all obstacles.   \n",

Some forms of new media, however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate reality by stimulating our senses.   \n",

According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.   \n",

This life-giving substance  is not, however, distributed evenly with (a) depth in the  oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface  layer 10 - 20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere  can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of  floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis.  Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and  reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths  of around 200 -1,000 metres. This region is referred to as  the oxygen (b) minimum zone. This zone is created by the  low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of  the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of  oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the  surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone,  oxygen content (c) increases again with depth. The deep  oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not  generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of  oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of  deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold,  oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That  seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby (d) exhausting its  oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface  waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively  scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms  therefore consume (e) little of the available oxygen. * dissolve: 용해시키다 ** diffuse: 퍼지다   \n",

Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans ① their first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, ② is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon ③ where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have ④ been used to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and ⑤ discovers deeper meanings in events. * monument: 기념비  ** eclipse: (해･달의) 식(蝕) *** testimony: 증언   \n",

Some forms of new media, however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate reality by stimulating our senses.</td>\n",

According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.</td>\n",

This life-giving substance  is not, however, distributed evenly with (a) depth in the  oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface  layer 10 - 20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere  can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of  floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis.  Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and  reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths  of around 200 -1,000 metres. This region is referred to as  the oxygen (b) minimum zone. This zone is created by the  low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of  the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of  oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the  surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone,  oxygen content (c) increases again with depth. The deep  oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not  generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of  oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of  deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold,  oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That  seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby (d) exhausting its  oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface  waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively  scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms  therefore consume (e) little of the available oxygen. * dissolve: 용해시키다 ** diffuse: 퍼지다</td>\n",

Technically, if they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they get what they want. That, however, is not all they want. They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy and consideration; and they are in a position to get what they want. They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and fundamental basis of public relations. In order, therefore, for a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must have a philosophy and a method of doing business which will allow and insure that its people serve the public efficiently and in a pleasing manner.   \n",

Every performer experiences this feeling, even the greatest performers in the world. If you believe that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove yourself right even when you are wrong. Most seemingly impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities, focusing on what is within your control, taking the first step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step after that. If your commitment becomes weak, remember your dream and why it is important to you, find simple joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing learning. With a positive perspective and persistence, you will get through and find a way through all obstacles.   \n",

Some forms of new media, however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate reality by stimulating our senses.   \n",

According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.   \n",

Then Tammy and her family moved from the woodlands of New York State to an urban city outside of Los Angeles, California. The experience made her more aware of what was going on in the world. After returning to New York State with her family, Tammy faced another lesson in growing up. A gifted student, she was sent to college when she was just 14. Tammy was able to earn her high school diploma and some college credit before trying her hand at a number of different jobs. Eventually, she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and studied at the Institute of American Indian Arts. After graduating from the institute, she remained active with it and the museum there.   \n",

His sea lions worked for social rewards as well as fish. Consequently, he did not have to keep his sea lions hungry in order to make ① them perform. During and after the day’s performances, the sea lions could have all the fish ② they wanted. One result was that ③ they were not irritable, as any hungry animal might be. The sea lions were friendly to those humans they knew and enjoyed being with ④ them. I was surprised to see trainers on their lunch hour sunbathing in a pile with their sea lions. Another result of stopping food deprivation was that these sea lions grew and grew! In fact, ⑤ they became bigger than most trained sea lions in the past, which weren’t given enough food.   \n",

I used to train with a world-class runner who was constantly hooking himself up to pulse meters and pace keepers. He spent hours collecting data that he thought would help him improve. In fact, a good 25 percent of his athletic time was devoted to externals other than working out. Sports became so complex for him that he forgot how to enjoy himself. Contrast his approach with that of the late Abebe Bikila, the Ethiopian who won the 1960 Olympic Marathon running barefoot. High-tech clothing and digital watches were not part of his world. Abebe Bikila simply ran. Many times in running, and in other areas of life, less is more.   \n",

Their novel approach was to pursue rational inquiry through adversarial discussion: The best way to evaluate one set of ideas, they decided, was by [blank]. In the political sphere, the result was democracy, in which supporters of rival policies vied for rhetorical supremacy; in philosophy, it led to reasoned arguments and dialogues about the nature of the world; in science, it prompted the construction of competing theories to try to explain natural phenomena; in the field of law, the result was the adversarial legal system. This approach is the foundation for the modern Western way of life, in which politics, commerce, science, and law are all rooted in orderly competition.  * adversarial: 대립 관계의 ** vie: 다투다, 경쟁하다   \n",

A painter making a fresco has limited time before the paint dries, and once it has dried, no further changes to the image are possible. Similarly, a traditional filmmaker has limited means of modifying images once they are recorded on film. Medieval tempera painting can be compared to the practice of special effects during the analog period of cinema. A painter working with tempera could modify and rework the image, but the process was painstaking and slow. The switch to oils greatly liberated painters by allowing them to quickly create much larger compositions as well as to modify them as long as necessary. Similarly, [blank], digital technology redefines what can be done with cinema.   \n",

(A) , a friend might react to a plan for dinner with a comment like “that’s good,” but with little vocal enthusiasm and a muted facial expression. In spite of the verbal comment, the lack of expressive enthusiasm suggests that the plan isn’t viewed very positively. In such a case, the purpose of the positive comment might be to avoid a disagreement and support the friend, but the lack of a positive expression unintentionally leaks a more candid, negative reaction to the plan. Of course, the muted expressive display might also be strategic and intentional. (B) , the nonverbal message is deliberate, but designed to let the partner know one’s candid reaction indirectly. It is then the partner’s responsibility to interpret the nonverbal message and make some adjustment in the plan. (A) (B)   \n",

That amount of money was beyond my wildest expectations. I was sure I hadn’t heard him right. I couldn’t have. I asked, “Did you say it went for forty thousand dollars?” Bill said it again as clearly as he could, “Four hundred thousand dollars. Congratulations, Steve.” “Are you sure, Bill?” I said in disbelief. He said he was. We talked for another half an hour, but I don’t remember a single word of what we said.   \n",

Music can convey the quality and size of a space. ① For example, in Alien and Olivier’s Hamlet, the music serves at times to make small and/or artificial spaces seem more grand and to enhance the sense of realism. ② In addition, music can establish a narrative’s placement in time. ③ Music for motion pictures often serves to authenticate the era or to provide a sense of nostalgia. ④ Music has traditionally been classified by musical instruments. ⑤ Examples of the former would include Amadeus and Immortal Beloved, while a sense of nostalgia is communicated through the music selected for films such as American Graffiti and The Big Chill.   \n",

On that first night to myself, Dad entrusted me with his movie projector and all the reels of film. (A) Then I can play the film backward and watch the cat fly down to the floor and see all the splashes of ice cream slurp themselves back into the dish. I made Simon jump in and out several times before I watched the rest of the film. (B) He said I could do everything myself that night. So I set up the screen at one end of the living room. I turned on the projector, turned off the light, put the bowl of popcorn in my lap, and settled in to watch the film labeled HATTIE-1951. (C) It’s one of my favorites because my third birthday party is on it and I can watch our old cat Simon jump up on the dining room table and land in a dish of ice cream. * slurp: 후루룩 소리를 내다   \n",

However, there is one issue that needs further consideration. (A) In addition to that benefit, helping lower-ability students often pulls higher-ability students to a more sophisticated understanding of the material. The cliché that teachers learn as much as their pupils is certainly true. (B) Not quite. Knowledge, happily, is not a zero-sum product. Higher-ability students can reinforce their own knowledge by teaching those with lower ability. (C) Specifically, the technique of having students help one another raises the question of whether students with lower ability are being helped at the expense of those with higher ability. Is this true?   \n",

Parents often believe that they are providing help to their children when they constantly correct and criticize them, assuming that they will grow from these remarks. But ask yourself: Do you like being corrected? Do you grow when you are constantly criticized? ( ① ) In truth, we tend to stay the same when we are criticized. ( ② ) We want to defend what we have done, and our innate stubbornness refuses to permit us to accept the criticism we are receiving. ( ③ ) Behind virtually all criticism is the sentence “If only you were more like me, and living life as I see it, you would be a lot better off.” ( ④ ) Praise your children for attempting a task, even if it was unsuccessful, and for taking risks. ( ⑤ ) Create an environment in which your children know that you are with them in their efforts, rather than looking to criticize them.   \n",

How can we explain the complexity of the path it chose? We can think up a sophisticated program in the ant’s brain, but it does not work. What we have overlooked is the ant’s environment. The ant may be following a simple rule: get out of the sun and back to the nest. Complex behavior does not imply complex mental strategies. The same holds for humans. The apparent complexity of a man’s behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which he finds himself. People adapt to their environments much as gelatin does; if you wish to know what form it will have when it solidifies, study the shape of the mold that holds the gelatin. To understand behavior, one has to look at both the mind and the environment. * gelatin: 젤라틴, 정제한 아교 󰀻 Although we tend to (A) complex behavior with complex mental operations, (B) factors need to be considered as well for a better understanding of such behavior.   \n",

However, after a great deal of thought, I have decided not to accept the position. Your company has an excellent reputation as a research institution and has many aspects that are very attractive to me. Unfortunately, I cannot accept your offer because I have decided to pursue another opportunity. Once again, thank you for your consideration. Very truly yours, Christine Mahoe</td>\n",

According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.</td>\n",

A painter making a fresco has limited time before the paint dries, and once it has dried, no further changes to the image are possible. Similarly, a traditional filmmaker has limited means of modifying images once they are recorded on film. Medieval tempera painting can be compared to the practice of special effects during the analog period of cinema. A painter working with tempera could modify and rework the image, but the process was painstaking and slow. The switch to oils greatly liberated painters by allowing them to quickly create much larger compositions as well as to modify them as long as necessary.

That amount of money was beyond my wildest expectations. I was sure I hadn’t heard him right. I couldn’t have. I asked, “Did you say it went for forty thousand dollars?” Bill said it again as clearly as he could, “Four hundred thousand dollars. Congratulations, Steve.” “Are you sure, Bill?” I said in disbelief. He said he was. We talked for another half an hour, but I don’t remember a single word of what we said.</td>\n",

As people chanted my name, (a) I was carried off the field on the shoulders of my teammates. Although I wasn’t a great student or a great football player, I ended up not only graduating from my dream university but becoming a hero of the team. People keep asking me how I did it. Here is my story.\\n(B) It was so hard to break out of the box, but (b) I began to feel an urgent need for a change. I signed up for the Army and went to the Vietnam War. A lot of people were worried, but I said, “Well, I’m going to get out of my box by deciding what to do myself instead of having someone else tell (c) me what to do.” With that one crucial shift in thinking, my whole attitude changed. I began to dream of going to one of the best universities in the country and playing football.\\n(C) I was born into a large poor family in Chicago. As a kid, I had visions of being a hero ― a police officer or an astronaut. However, people would always tell me, “You can’t do that. You aren’t smart enough. You aren’t strong enough.” Moreover, (d) I didn’t do well in school, and I had no hope of getting into any college. After high school, I gave up on my dream of going to college and got a part-time job instead. I felt like I was living in a box labeled “This is where you belong.”\\n(D) After I finished my time in the Army, I packed my bags and went to my dream university. I knocked on the door of one of the professors’ offices and said, “Please, tell me how to get in here.” The professor could see that I was determined. He said, “I can’t let you in the university, but (e) I will see you whenever you need my advice or help.” It took me a long time, but I eventually got into that university, became a football player, and graduated.</td>\n",

Your company has an excellent reputation as a research institution and has many aspects that are very attractive to me. Unfortunately, I cannot accept your offer because I have decided to pursue another opportunity. Once again, thank you for your consideration. Very truly yours, Christine Mahoe   \n",

After all, it is efficient. Another person asks a question; we provide the answer to the question. It is usually a win-win. The problem with this is that the direct approach can have an unintended consequence: the loss of confidence. Although the question wanted for an explanation, what the asker received was a statement of fact. Why does oil float on top of water in a glass? Relative density. What causes climate change? Increased CO2 in the atmosphere. Why does the ocean have tides? The moon. Giving direct, accurate, and factual answers may seem to solve the problem from the perspective of the answerer. But in reality, it can shut the asker down. A statement of fact with no other context puts the burden on the asker to take the next step. If the asker isn’t familiar with relative density or CO2, he or she is likely to move on rather than ask a follow-up question or probe for related ideas. Any hope of becoming a customer of that idea is lost. This is a failure in the form of a lost opportunity. Although direct answers are often needed and well-placed, they do not work universally. A skilled explainer learns to see the intent behind the question and formulate an answer that focuses on understanding instead of [blank].   \n",

              "71    Increased size affects group life in a number of ways. There is evidence that larger groups (five or six members) are more productive than smaller groups (two or three members). Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than members of smaller groups, and although they seem to reach less agreement, they also show less tension. These differences may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve organizational problems. Members may realize that their behavior must become more goal-directed, since it is unlikely that they can coordinate their actions without making a special effort to do so. Larger groups also put more pressure on their members to conform. In such groups, it is harder for everyone to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount of influence on decisions.\\nThere is evidence that groups with an even number of members differ from groups with an odd number of members. The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more deadlocks as a result. Groups with an even number of members may split into halves. This is impossible in groups with an odd number of members ― one side always has a numerical advantage. According to some researchers, the number five has special significance.

Groups of five rate high in member satisfaction; because of the odd number of members, deadlocks are unlikely when disagreements occur.   \n",

His legs were shaking so much it  was hard to walk. He was taking short, fast breaths, but it felt  like his lungs were empty. He needed more oxygen.

You’ve had some  bad news. You tell someone else about it. They say, “Just call  me if you need help,’ ‘If I can do anything, let me know.’  These offers are well-meaning, but they are vague. It’s hard to  know whether they have been made just for the sake of  politeness. What’s the lesson here? If you e offering help,  make your offer specific. For example, if your friend’s child is  in hospital, you might realize that shopping for groceries may  seem overwhelming under the circumstances. You could ask,  “Can I help by doing a grocery run?\" The same principle applies  in the case of minor problems. If your colleague appears  overworked and stressed one morning, don’t just stand there  and say, ‘ You look busy, so let me know if you need help.\" It  would be better to say, “Can I help by doing that filing for you?\"   \n",

While playing, the young animal may be  at great (A) comfort / risk. For example, 86 percent of young  Southern fur seals eaten by sea lions were play-swimming with  others when they were caught. Against these costs many  functions have been proposed for play, including practice for  adult behaviours such as hunting or fighting, and for developing  motor and social interaction skills. However, for these theories,  there is (B) much / little experimental evidence in animals. For  example, detailed studies which tracked juvenile play and adult  behaviour of meerkats couldn’t prove that play-fighting  influenced fighting ability as an adult. Therefore, the persistence  of play across so many animal species (C) remains / resolves a  mystery. The answers are likely to involve diverse and multiple  factors, which may be quite different in different species, as  might what we call play itself. * forage: 먹이를 찾아 다니다 **juvenile: 성장기의   \n",

When a hare is  being chased, it zigzags in a random pattern in an attempt to  shake off the pursuer. This technique will be more reliable if it  is genuinely random, as it is better for the hare to have no  foreknowledge of where it is going to jump next: if it knew  where it was going to jump next, its posture might reveal clues  to its pursuer. Over time, dogs would learn to anticipate these  cues - with fatal consequences for the hare. Those hares with  more self-awareness would tend to die out, so most modern  hares are probably descended from those that had less  self-knowledge. In the same way, humans may be descended  from ancestors who were better at the concealment of their true  motives. It is not enough to conceal them from others - to be  really convincing, you also have to conceal them from yourself. * hare: 끼   \n",

(A) Many branches broke off from each other and developed  branches of their own, instead. There were at least three  or four different species of hominids living simultaneously  for most of the past five million years. Of all these  branches, only one survived until today: ours. (B) However, that is exactly what almost happened - many  times, in fact. From the fossil record and from DNA  analysis, we can tell that our ancestors nearly went extinct,  and their population shrunk to very small  numbers countless times. (C) In addition, there are many lineages of hominids that did  go extinct. Since the split between Our ancestors and those  of the chimps, our lineage has not been a single line of  gradual change. Evolution never works that way. * hominid: 진화 의 모체가 된 사람이나 동물 ** lineage: 혈통   \n",

Another person asks a question; we provide the answer to the question. It is usually a win-win. The problem with this is that the direct approach can have an unintended consequence: the loss of confidence. Although the question wanted for an explanation, what the asker received was a statement of fact. Why does oil float on top of water in a glass? Relative density. What causes climate change? Increased CO2 in the atmosphere. Why does the ocean have tides? The moon. Giving direct, accurate, and factual answers may seem to solve the problem from the perspective of the answerer. But in reality, it can shut the asker down. A statement of fact with no other context puts the burden on the asker to take the next step. If the asker isn’t familiar with relative density or CO2, he or she is likely to move on rather than ask a follow-up question or probe for related ideas. Any hope of becoming a customer of that idea is lost. This is a failure in the form of a lost opportunity. Although direct answers are often needed and well-placed, they do not work universally. A skilled explainer learns to see the intent behind the question and formulate an answer that focuses on understanding instead of [blank].</td>\n",

There is evidence that larger groups (five or six members) are more productive than smaller groups (two or three members). Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than members of smaller groups, and although they seem to reach less agreement, they also show less tension. These differences may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve organizational problems. Members may realize that their behavior must become more goal-directed, since it is unlikely that they can coordinate their actions without making a special effort to do so. Larger groups also put more pressure on their members to conform. In such groups, it is harder for everyone to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount of influence on decisions.\\nThere is evidence that groups with an even number of members differ from groups with an odd number of members. The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more deadlocks as a result. Groups with an even number of members may split into halves. This is impossible in groups with an odd number of members ― one side always has a numerical advantage. According to some researchers, the number five has special significance. Groups of this size usually [blank] the problems we have just outlined. Moreover, they are not plagued by the fragility and tensions found in groups of two or three. Groups of five rate high in member satisfaction; because of the odd number of members, deadlocks are unlikely when disagreements occur.</td>\n",

It’s hard to  know whether they have been made just for the sake of  politeness. What’s the lesson here? If you e offering help,  make your offer specific. For example, if your friend’s child is  in hospital, you might realize that shopping for groceries may  seem overwhelming under the circumstances. You could ask,  “Can I help by doing a grocery run?\" The same principle applies  in the case of minor problems. If your colleague appears  overworked and stressed one morning, don’t just stand there  and say, ‘ You look busy, so let me know if you need help.\" It  would be better to say, “Can I help by doing that filing for you?\"</td>\n",

For example, 86 percent of young  Southern fur seals eaten by sea lions were play-swimming with  others when they were caught. Against these costs many  functions have been proposed for play, including practice for  adult behaviours such as hunting or fighting, and for developing  motor and social interaction skills. However, for these theories,  there is (B) much / little experimental evidence in animals. For  example, detailed studies which tracked juvenile play and adult  behaviour of meerkats couldn’t prove that play-fighting  influenced fighting ability as an adult. Therefore, the persistence  of play across so many animal species (C) remains / resolves a  mystery. The answers are likely to involve diverse and multiple  factors, which may be quite different in different species, as  might what we call play itself. * forage: 먹이를 찾아 다니다 **juvenile: 성장기의</td>\n",

When a hare is  being chased, it zigzags in a random pattern in an attempt to  shake off the pursuer. This technique will be more reliable if it  is genuinely random, as it is better for the hare to have no  foreknowledge of where it is going to jump next: if it knew  where it was going to jump next, its posture might reveal clues  to its pursuer. Over time, dogs would learn to anticipate these  cues - with fatal consequences for the hare. Those hares with  more self-awareness would tend to die out, so most modern  hares are probably descended from those that had less  self-knowledge. In the same way, humans may be descended  from ancestors who were better at the concealment of their true  motives. It is not enough to conceal them from others - to be  really convincing, you also have to conceal them from yourself. * hare: 끼</td>\n",

Technically, if they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they get what they want. That, however, is not all they want. They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy and consideration; and they are in a position to get what they want. They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and fundamental basis of public relations. In order, therefore, for a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must have a philosophy and a method of doing business which will allow and insure that its people serve the public efficiently and in a pleasing manner.   \n",

Every performer experiences this feeling, even the greatest performers in the world. If you believe that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove yourself right even when you are wrong. Most seemingly impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities, focusing on what is within your control, taking the first step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step after that. If your commitment becomes weak, remember your dream and why it is important to you, find simple joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing learning. With a positive perspective and persistence, you will get through and find a way through all obstacles.   \n",

Some forms of new media, however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of motion and touch. New media may also include aromas, such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate reality by stimulating our senses.   \n",

According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher, perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of coupling together the positive emotions of members of a group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and begin laughing too.   \n",

Early astronomy provided information about when to plant crops and gave humans ① their first formal method of recording the passage of time. Stonehenge, the 4,000-year-old ring of stones in southern Britain, ② is perhaps the best-known monument to the discovery of regularity and predictability in the world we inhabit. The great markers of Stonehenge point to the spots on the horizon ③ where the sun rises at the solstices and equinoxes ― the dates we still use to mark the beginnings of the seasons. The stones may even have ④ been used to predict eclipses. The existence of Stonehenge, built by people without writing, bears silent testimony both to the regularity of nature and to the ability of the human mind to see behind immediate appearances and ⑤ discovers deeper meanings in events. * monument: 기념비  ** eclipse: (해･달의) 식(蝕) *** testimony: 증언   \n",

Another consistent research finding is that when a learning activity is undertaken explicitly to attain some extrinsic reward, people respond by seeking the least demanding way of ensuring the reward.

So there’s no reason why we should pay for your service’. The case went to court, and the composers won on appeal. The decision extended an existing law on theatrical performances to all musical works and all public performance of those works. This decision created a new category of legal right ― the performing right ― and with it a new economic relationship between music user and copyright owner. As a result of the decision, these composers and others including music publishers founded a society to enforce and administer their performing rights. In doing so, they established the principle and practice of the collective administration of rights, based on the fact that ― with the possible exception of opera performances ― it was impossible for a single composer or publisher to monitor every use of his or her work by singers, bands, promoters or, in the twentieth century, broadcasters. , the new society was entrusted with the task of monitoring music use, issuing licences to music users, negotiating fees, collecting fees and finally distributing the money raised to the composers and songwriters whose works were adding value to other people’s businesses.\\\\n\\\\n[\\'the cultural significance of musical performance\\', \\'strategies for creating public interest through music\\', \\'the rise of performing rights in music and its effects\\', \\'performing arts for the public and their artistic value\\', \\'the influence of the new society on increasing licence fees\\']\\\\n③\"}]}',\n",

Infants who are able to sit alone are granted an entirely different perspective on the world than are those who spend much of their day on their backs or stomachs.

In 2008, American food and wine critics teamed up with a statistician from Yale and a couple of Swedish economists to study the results of thousands of blind tastings of wines ranging from $1.65 to $150 a bottle.

As Edmund Burke observed two centuries ago, “Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites.” Autonomy has never been a one-way street and is never granted absolutely and irreversibly. * autonomy: 자율성 ** privilege: 특권 *** premise: 전제로 말하다\\\\n\\\\n[\\'전문직에 부여되는 자율성은 그에 상응하는 사회적 책임을 수반한다.\\', \\'전문직의 권위는 해당 집단의 이익을 추구하는 데 이용되어 왔다.\\', \\'전문직의 사회적 책임을 규정할 수 있는 제도 정비가 필요하다.\\', \\'전문직이 되기 위한 자격 요건은 사회 경제적 요구에 따라 변화해 왔다.\\', \\'전문직의 업무 성과는 일정 수준의 자율성과 특권이 부여될 때 높아진다.\\']\\\\n①\"}]}',\n",

Over the years, as socioeconomic classes arose in society in the Middle Ages, work began to be seen as the curse of the poor. The wealthy in society did all they could to avoid labor, perhaps except for war, which was seen as noble. Eventually enlightened philosophers such as St. Thomas Aquinas and his contemporaries taught that work was important, especially if we used our surplus to help others. Their teachings influenced reformers such as Martin Luther, who explained that work was virtuous if we had integrity and were honest in our dealings with our fellow men. Later, as America and Canada expanded into new territories, work in contemporary society was described as a privilege of the free. Then, as we entered the 1900s, Henry Ford and other industrialists convinced us that work led to progress for our society and our families. * penance: 속죄\\\\n\\\\n[\\'various ways to improve working conditions\\', \\'changes in the perception of work over time\\', \\'efforts to raise awareness about workers’ rights\\', \\'influences of the working class on modern society\\', \\'relationships between working hours and productivity\\']\\\\n②\"}]}',\n",

There are plenty of other situations in which, in the short term, it may be more comfortable not to tell the truth to followers. Ultimately, however, even dishonesty that was meant to protect employee morale will eventually be exposed, undermining trustworthiness at a time when commitment to the organization is most vital. Even concerted efforts at secrecy can backfire, as employees may simply “fill in the gaps” in their understanding with their own theories about the leader’s behavior. Therefore, leaders need to take steps to explain the true reasons for their decisions to those individuals affected by it, leaving less room for negative interpretations of leader behavior.\\\\n\\\\n[\\'조직이 처할 위기를 예측하여 사전 대책 수립이 필요하다.\\', \\'리더는 업무 효율 향상을 위해 구성원의 사기를 높여야 한다.\\', \\'조직에 대한 과도한 헌신을 강조하는 것은 역효과를 초래한다.\\', \\'리더는 구성원의 비판적 의견을 수용하는 자세를 가져야 한다.\\', \\'리더는 조직 내 신뢰 유지를 위해 구성원에게 진실을 알려야 한다.\\']\\\\n⑤\"}]}',\n",

Because the warmest air is near the surface, the light takes less time to get to your eye if it travels down near the ground and then returns up to your eye than it would if it came directly in a straight line to your eye. Fermat formulated a principle, which says that, to determine the ultimate path of any light ray, you simply need to examine all possible paths from A to B and find the one that takes the least time. This makes it sound as if light has [blak], and I resisted the temptation to say light considers all paths and chooses the one that takes the least time. This is because I fully expect that my online opponent Deepak Chopra would later quote me as implying that light has consciousness. Light does not have consciousness, but the mathematical result makes it appear as if light chooses the shortest distance.\\\\n\\\\n[\\'intentionality\\', \\'randomness\\', \\'resistance\\', \\'intensity\\', \\'durability\\']\\\\n⑤\"}]}',\n",

(A) That’s a clever trick, because producing spines and a helmet is costly, in terms of energy, and conserving energy is essential for an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. The water flea only expends the energy needed to produce spines and a helmet when it needs to. (B) If the baby water flea is developing into an adult in water that includes the chemical signatures of creatures that prey on water fleas, it develops a helmet and spines to defend itself against predators. If the water around it doesn’t include the chemical signatures of predators, the water flea doesn’t develop these protective devices. (C) So it may well be that this plasticity is an adaptation: a trait that came to exist in a species because it contributed to reproductive fitness.

Their slogan was, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” (B) Yet, we notice something interesting: The melody is still recognizable ― as long as the relationship between notes remains the same. Now, what would happen if you played the notes of “Happy Birthday” in the correct order, but at a rate of one per hour? What would we have? Nothing! (C) The separate notes would no longer be a melody. Perceptually, the melody is somehow more than the individual notes that define it. It was observations like these that launched the Gestalt school of thought. * tuba: 튜바(금관 악기의 일종)\\\\n\\\\n[\\'(A) - (C) - (B)\\', \\'(B) - (A) - (C)\\', \\'(B) - (C) - (A)\\', \\'(C) - (A) - (B)\\', \\'(C) - (B) - (A)\\']\\\\n③\"}]}',\n",

I don’t know the rules of Uno, but apparently there are a couple of different ways you can play, various alternative rules and strategies that everyone must agree on at the beginning of the game.

Hurriedly, he grabbed his coat and rushed toward the stage. (C) As she turned to talk with friends, her son could stay seated no longer. (d) He slipped away from her side, strangely drawn to the black concert grand piano and its leather stool on the huge stage flooded with blinding lights.

He placed his small, shaky fingers in the right location and began to play “Chopsticks.” (D) Without one word of announcement Paderewski bent over behind the boy, reached around both sides, began to improvise a countermelody to harmonize with and enhance “Chopsticks.” As the two of them played together, (e) he kept whispering in the boy’s ear: “Keep going. Don’t quit. Keep on playing... don’t stop... don’t quit.” Together, the old master and the little boy transformed an embarrassing situation into a wonderfully creative experience.

Try  to see with them as well.“ (C) After that day, Professor Wells never saw Jack again. It  was not until six years later that he saw a report in the  newspaper about a recent exhibition of modern art.

Tourism allows people from different places and cultures to come together, and then tourists and host communities learn about each other’s differences and similarities.

Another positive effect of tourism is the aid it provides for the survival of a society’s culture, especially the culture’s art forms.

Another consistent research finding is that when a learning activity is undertaken explicitly to attain some extrinsic reward, people respond by seeking the least demanding way of ensuring the reward.

This decision created a new category of legal right ― the performing right ― and with it a new economic relationship between music user and copyright owner.

A study of Stanford University alumni found that those “who have varied work and educational backgrounds are much more likely to start their own businesses than those who have focused on one role at work or concentrated in one subject at school.” To cultivate an entrepreneurial culture, colleges and universities need to offer students a broad choice of experiences and wide exposure to different ideas.

The subjects were asked to rate each of the people in the pictures according to several scales. The results were predictable.

Because the warmest air is near the surface, the light takes less time to get to your eye if it travels down near the ground and then returns up to your eye than it would if it came directly in a straight line to your eye. Fermat formulated a principle, which says that, to determine the ultimate path of any light ray, you simply need to examine all possible paths from A to B and find the one that takes the least time. This makes it sound as if light has [blak], and I resisted the temptation to say light considers all paths and chooses the one that takes the least time. This is because I fully expect that my online opponent Deepak Chopra would later quote me as implying that light has consciousness. Light does not have consciousness, but the mathematical result makes it appear as if light chooses the shortest distance.\\\\n\\\\n[\\'intentionality\\', \\'randomness\\', \\'resistance\\', \\'intensity\\', \\'durability\\']\\\\n⑤\"}]},\\n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a high school English test question designer.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please create a Fill-in-the-Blank-with-Single-Word questionThe blank should encapsulate the overarching idea presented in the text.

He took charge of about a dozen failing “special ed” kids, and Tisha and Kelly were among them. His idealism ran high, and he thought he would be able to magically fix all of their problems.\\n(D) Jeremy knew something had to change. (e) He then thought back to my class, remembering how negative emotions can drag you down, leaving positive emotions unnoticed. That’s when he decided to focus more on building positive attitudes within the classroom. He borrowed lessons from my positive psychology class and even mentioned my name to his students. As the students’ attitudes became more optimistic, their confidence with math grew too.

Angela came to see Julia because she was having doubts about her career plans. For the last three years Angela had worked as a legal analyst at a company. The problem was that (a) she didn’t have much of a passion for law. She had never enjoyed reading law books, or attended a legal workshop because she was eager to learn.  (B) Julia kept encouraging Angela and Angela began to think about how she could get involved in acting. She remembered that there were some people at her work who were interested in acting. The next week at work, Angela sent an email to her colleagues announcing her interest in starting a drama group. Four people agreed to join her.

(C) As Angela described her situation, Julia noted that there was little enthusiasm in her voice. So the first thing (c) she decided to do was to help Angela increase the fun in her life. Julia asked her if there were any fun things she would like to do. Angela mentioned that for a long time she had wanted to get back into acting, which she used to do in college. As (d) she talked about her acting experiences, she spoke enthusiastically and Julia felt it was like watching an entirely different person. (D) Now Angela realized that she wanted to work in a setting where she could interact with many different types of people in a fun, supportive way. This, she saw, was unlikely to occur in the legal profession. After exploring many possibilities, Angela ended up becoming a drama teacher at a high school.

During recess one day, Andrew got involved in a card game of Uno with three other boys: Timmy, Travis, and a fourth boy whose name I don’t remember. I don’t know the rules of Uno, but apparently there are a couple of different ways you can play, various alternative rules and strategies that everyone must agree on at the beginning of the game. At that time I thought the boys did not confirm in advance what the rules would be because early on in the game Timmy managed to successfully execute a very rare move, and the three others told (a)him to take it back. (B) I knew I needed to step in despite the fact that my intervention could make things even worse. But before I could stand up I heard Andrew confront Travis, saying, “Leave (b)him alone. So what if he’s crying? You still cry sometimes, don’t you?” And that was it. In a poem I wrote I call it the “noblest act of courage I have ever seen,” and it still makes me shiver. Andrew was not exactly immune to Travis’s cruelty; Travis could easily have teased Andrew for being fat for his size, as he often did. (C) He was quite pleased with himself for placing his cards on the discard pile and was naturally crushed when the three other boys all told (c)him the move was not allowed in that particular game, that they were “not playing that way.” Timmy took his cards back, but (d) his bottom lip began to quiver. Seeing that vulnerability, cruel Travis began circling for the kill. “What? Are you about to cry? It’s just a game! And you’re going to cry? Look at Timmy, everyone, he’s crying! What a big baby!” (D) Nevertheless, Andrew Marks, knowing that what he was witnessing was bullying, pure and simple, put himself between the bully and the victim and took the bullet. When I called his mother that night to tell her what had happened, I think I cried myself. I told Mrs. Marks that Andrew was the kind of student who made me proud to be a teacher and that I had wanted to be just like (e)him when I was growing up.\\\\n\\\\n[\\'(B) - (D) - (C)\\', \\'(C) - (B) - (D)\\', \\'(C) - (D) - (B)\\', \\'(D) - (B) - (C)\\', \\'(D) - (C) - (B)\\']\\\\n②\"}]},\\n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a high school English test question designer.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please create a sequence-inference questionPlease provide the first two sentences, then divide the remaining text into three parts, with 2-3 sentences in each part.
